We quantified hay production as total biomass production in the grasslands. Between mid-May and mid-June each year, aboveground biomass was harvested by clipping the vegetation 2–3 cm above ground in four randomly placed quadrats of 0.5m × 0.5m in each subplot. The plant biomass was dried at 80°C for 48 hours, weighed and summed over the four quadrats. Biomass was then averaged between 2008 and 2012. In order to convert this one-time biomass measurements into estimates of annual field productivity, we used the information on the number of cuts and the number of livestock units at a site to estimate the total annual biomass production harvested by farming activities, i.e. converted into fodder or consumed directly by livestock. Details of this estimation process can be found in Simons, N. K. & Weisser, W. W. Agricultural intensification without biodiversity loss is possible in grassland landscapes.

The biomass data was extracted from Bexis datasets 5401, 16209, 12706, 14346, 14986 (available on Bexis). Information on agricultural practices can be found in 26487. Productivity is show in dt/ha.
